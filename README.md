•   https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp
•	https://docs.python.org/3/


## DESCRIPTION
In this lab, you will write a program or script in a language other than C. You can use any language other than C. Examples include JavaScript, Java, Python, Rust, Go, C++, or PHP. There are several others listed here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages 

## PROGRAM/SCRIPT GOALS
Your program or script should do all the following:
•	Read a string and print its length
•	Fill an array or list with 5 random numbers from 0 to 99
•	Separately from the filling part, print those numbers out

## DELIVERABLES
You need to submit a Word or PDF document with screenshots of your source code and the program or script working. If you're able to submit the source code, please do that as well.

## NOTES
The expectation is you will research another language briefly and use the language documentation or a tutorial to pick up some of the differences between C and the new language.
